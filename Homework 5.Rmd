## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

###Question 1:

```{r}

MinutesPlayed = as.numeric()
wnba_players <- data.frame(
  Player = WNBA_Stats_Sheet1_1_$Player,
  MinutesPlayed = WNBA_Stats_Sheet1_1_$MP...5,
  ThreePointPercentage = WNBA_Stats_Sheet1_1_$`3P%`
)

head(WNBA_Stats_Sheet1)

player_count <- nrow(WNBA_Stats_Sheet1)
player_count
```

###Question 2:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

summary(wnba_players$ThreePointPercentage)

# Histogram to show the distribution of three-point shooting percentage
ggplot(wnba_players, aes(x = ThreePointPercentage)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.07, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Three-Point Shooting Percentage",
       x = "Three-Point Shooting Percentage (%)", y = "Number of Players")



```

```{r}
highlighted_data <- wnba_players |>
  filter(Player == "Lindsay Allen")

# Scatter plot for minutes played vs. three-point shooting percentage
ggplot(wnba_players, aes(x = MinutesPlayed, y = ThreePointPercentage)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = highlighted_data, aes(x = MinutesPlayed, y = ThreePointPercentage), 
             color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = highlighted_data, aes(x = MinutesPlayed, y = ThreePointPercentage, label = Player), 
            color = "red", nudge_y = 0.5) +  # 'nudge_y' helps position the label slightly above the point
  labs(title = "Minutes Played vs. Three-Point Shooting Percentage",
       x = "Minutes Played", y = "Three-Point Shooting Percentage (%)")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
